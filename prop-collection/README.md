# Props Collection (WIP)


### What are prop collection

Prop Collection is a pattern where we can access props form the parent component by passing a single object of props.

### What is so special about this pattern?

I would prefer using Prop Getters to be more flexible since Prop Collection passes object instead of function which is not very flexible.


Here's the code WIP [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/yrjmqol7j)
